They are sometimes subtle and may be overlooked for months or even years. But for some people  signs and symptoms develop suddenly. Signs and symptoms of hypopituitarism vary from person to person  depending on which pituitary hormones are affected and to what degree. In people who have more than one pituitary hormone deficiency  the second deficiency may increase or  in some cases  hide the symptoms of the first deficiency. Growth hormone (GH) deficiency In children  GH deficiency may cause growth problems and short stature. Most adults who have GH deficiency don't have any symptoms  but for some adults it can cause: GH GHFatigue Muscle weakness Changes in body fat composition Lack of ambition Social isolationLuteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) deficiency Deficiency of these hormones  called gonadotropins  affect the reproductive system. In women  the deficiency decreases egg and estrogen production from the ovaries. In men  the deficiency decreases sperm and testosterone production from the testicles. Women and men may experience a lower sex drive  infertility or fatigue. In children and adolescents  delayed puberty is usually the only symptom. Women may also have symptoms such as:Hot flashes Irregular or no periods Loss of pubic hair An inability to produce milk for breast-feedingMen may also have symptoms such as:Erectile dysfunction Decreased facial or body hair Mood changesThyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) deficiency This hormone controls the thyroid gland. A TSH deficiency leads to low levels of thyroid hormones (hypothyroidism). This causes symptoms such as: TSHFatigue Weight gain Dry skin Constipation Sensitivity to cold or difficulty staying warmAdrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) deficiency This hormone helps your adrenal glands work properly  and helps your body react to stress. Symptoms of ACTH deficiency include: ACTHSevere fatigue Low blood pressure  which may lead to fainting Frequent and prolonged infections Nausea  vomiting or abdominal pain ConfusionAnti-diuretic hormone (ADH) deficiency This hormone  which is also called vasopressin  helps your body balance its fluid levels. An ADH deficiency can cause a disorder called diabetes insipidus  which can cause: ADHExcessive urination Extreme thirst Electrolyte imbalancesProlactin deficiency Prolactin is the hormone that tells the body when to start making breast milk. Low levels of prolactin can cause women to have problems making milk for breast-feeding." }, { "role": "assistant", "content" : "You may have Hypopituitarism"}]}

Signs and symptoms vary depending on the type of plague. Bubonic plague Bubonic plague is the most common variety of the disease. It's named after the swollen lymph nodes (buboes) that typically develop in the first week after you become infected. Buboes may be:Situated in the groin  armpit or neck About the size of a chicken egg Tender and firm to the touch Other bubonic plague signs and symptoms may include:Sudden onset of fever and chills Headache Fatigue or malaise Muscle achesSepticemic plague Septicemic plague occurs when plague bacteria multiply in your bloodstream. Signs and symptoms include:Fever and chills Extreme weakness Abdominal pain  diarrhea and vomiting Bleeding from your mouth  nose or rectum  or under your skin Shock Blackening and death of tissue (gangrene) in your extremities  most commonly your fingers  toes and nosePneumonic plague Pneumonic plague affects the lungs. It's the least common variety of plague but the most dangerous  because it can be spread from person to person via cough droplets. Signs and symptoms can begin within a few hours after infection  and may include:Cough  with bloody mucus (sputum) Difficulty breathing Nausea and vomiting High fever Headache Weakness Chest painPneumonic plague progresses rapidly and may cause respiratory failure and shock within two days of infection. Pneumonic plague needs to be treated with antibiotics within a day after signs and symptoms first appear  or the infection is likely to be fatal." }, { "role": "assistant", "content" : "You may have Plague"}]}
